            <p class="desc">I'm Sam Deniz, an autistic web designer and developer based in Fairport, New York.
            I majored in New Media Interactive Development, which covers programming and interactive development,
            at Rochester Institute of Technology, and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in 2023. While I was
            there, I found myself most at ease when designing and developing websites, especially with CSS, HTML,
            and JavaScript.<br><br>
            I believe that a strong website is one of the most important things for any organization with an Internet
            presence, including businesses and non-profits, to have. Many people interact with organizations through
            their websites, whether they're buying from an online retailer or donating to a charity, so a poorly
            designed website can cost you a potential interaction. With my knowledge of website design and development,
            I can make sure your website never makes you miss out on an interaction.<br><br>
