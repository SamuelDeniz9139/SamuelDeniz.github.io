                <p class="bio">I'm Samuel Deniz, a web designer and developer based in Fairport, New York. In 2023, I graduated
                from Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's of Science in New Media Interactive Development, which
                encompasses website design/development, mobile development, alternate interfaces, and more. While I was there,
                I found myself most at ease developing websites, with a particular fondness for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
                I believe that any organization with an Internet presence, including businesses and non-profits, should have a
                visually appealing and easily accessible website. Many people find out about companies thanks to the Internet,
                and a poorly-designed website can cost you a potential interaction. With my knowledge of website design and
                development, I can make sure your website never causes you miss out.</p>
