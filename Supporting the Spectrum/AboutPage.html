                <p>Supporting the Spectrum was created by Sam Deniz for New Media Capstone 2 in April 2023.<br><br>
                It's meant to be a collection of resources for people with autism to use when they need help.<br><br>
                Interactive demonstrations are present to help people without certain disorders understand them.<br><br>
                However, they are not meant to represent ALL people with depicted disorders.</p><br>
