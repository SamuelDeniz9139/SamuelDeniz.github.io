            <div class="noImage popUp">
                <p>I am a web designer and developer based in Fairport, New York. In 2023, I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology
                    with a Bachelor's of Science in New Media Interactive Development, which encompasses website design/development, mobile
                    development, alternate interfaces, and more. While I was there, I found myself most at ease developing websites, with a
                    particular fondness for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
                    I believe that any organization with an Internet presence, including businesses and non-profits, should have a visually
                    appealing and easily accessible website. Many people find out about companies thanks to the Internet, and a poorly-designed
                    website can cost you a potential interaction. With my knowledge of website design and development, I can make sure your
                    website never causes you to miss out.</p>
